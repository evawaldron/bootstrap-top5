                            expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets 
                            Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into 
                            her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, 
                            enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate.

                        <br>
                        I first read the book series in the seventh grade with my best friend Charlotte. We were instantly obsessed, 
                        but our moms prohibited us from watching the movies. That didn't stop us. We watched the whole series in one 
                        sitting during a sleepover after shopping at the mall with babysitting money. We gasped at the sight of Robert 
                        Pattinson and swooned at Bella's wedding and Christina Perri's song, "A Thousand Years." This movie, and the series, 
                        holds a sense of nostalgia in my heart that I will always hold onto and appreciate.

                        <p class="lead">Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is living in India when he is framed by Russian agent Kirill 
                            (Karl Urban) for the theft of millions from the CIA. Kirill begins to pursue Bourne, intending to assassinate 
                            him -- but while Bourne and his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), are on the run, a shot meant for him kills 
                            her instead. Vowing revenge, Bourne sets out to prove his innocence and bring the culprits to justice, but he has 
                            to evade CIA head Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), who is convinced he is guilty.

                        <br>
                        While this movie is the second in the series (and my favorite), I was introduced to Jason Bourne by my grandmother. I 
                        was 16 and spending the night at her house when she suggested we watch this classic. With a singular, illegal glass of 
                        chilled Chardonnay in hand, I was immersed in the undercover world of Operation Treadstone. The fight scenes and car chases 
                        had me on the edge on her red couch. Specifically, in this second movie, I loved how the culture of various destinations were 
                        incorporated in the film.

                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">From the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a mammal metropolis where 
                            various animals live and thrive. When Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first rabbit to join the police 
                            force, she quickly learns how tough it is to enforce the law. Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the 
                            opportunity to solve a mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a 
                            wily fox who makes her job even harder.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            I have watched this movie a whopping 36 times. To explain, I work with children in the summers and I watched Zootopia twice 
                            a day, every Friday, for 3 months, every summer, for 2 years, and I still love it. Maybe it's the soothing voice of Ginnifer 
                            Goodwin or the sarcastic charm of Jason Bateman, but I will never get sick of watching this movie. Additionally, the theme song, 
                            "Try Everything," is a Shakira classic that makes the movie top tier.

                            to reveal personal messages and secrets of thousands of people. As anger erupts into full-blown violence, the four 
                            girls soon find themselves in a fight for their lives against an armed mob.

                        <br>
                        The first time I watched this movie I was shocked and horrified, yet I still loved it and the film's characters. I was 
                        enchanted with the fashion and aesthetics of 21st century youth. A main reason I loved this movie was the relatability of 
                        social media. The characters are both invested and destroyed by social media and the grip online platforms have on populations.

                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">In 1970, paranormal investigators and demonologists Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) 
                            Warren are summoned to the home of Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston) Perron. The Perrons and their 
                            five daughters have recently moved into a secluded farmhouse, where a supernatural presence has made itself known.
                            Though the manifestations are relatively benign at first, events soon escalate in horrifying fashion, especially 
                            after the Warrens discover the house's macabre history.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This was the first horror movie I genuinely enjoyed that led to a 5-week long obsession with Patrick Wilson and the movie 
                        categories of thriller and horror. I spent many nights tucked into bed, in darkness, clutching my stuffed animals and waiting 
                        for the jump scare. My obsession faded after watching the most recent Conjuring film where, in my opinion, the movie fell a bit 
                        flat in comparison to its predecessors.
